Support
=======

The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the #mypdns
channel on oftc.
We hang out there and you can get real-time help with your projects.


The other good way is to open an issue on Github if you found a bug we couldn't fix on IRC

- oftc: irc://oftc.net
- Github: https://github.com/spirillen/rpz-block-list/issues

A lovely no -log in, -cookie option is out very own `Trac`_ where you can file a ticket or read the WIKI
